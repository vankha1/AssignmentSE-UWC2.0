* This is source code about my Software-Engineering course assignment. The assignment is task and staff management with functionalities such as filter, view detail, create, update,...
## Tech  
* I used HTML-CSS, JS for front-end and NodeJS (Express), Mongodb for back-end.
* Website meets main requirements and has CRUD data.

## Limit
* Filter functionality has some bugs that make me update myself more.
* Error handling haven't been good enough.

I will improve this website in the near future!!!!
