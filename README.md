# AssignmentSE-UWC2.0
UWC2.0 is an open-source application for a Software Engineering project to resolve the urban waste management problem. This system can store and manage employee information including Back Officer (Officer in charge), Collector (Driver of collection trucks) and Janitor (collector of garbage in MCP). Furthermore, it can also provide information about time for each employee's task and create an optimal route (using Google Map API) for each collector's task.

# How to use
To use the application, you will need to follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/hyla167/L02-Group-4.git` and `cd` into the cloned repository
2. Download NodeJS at https://nodejs.org/ if you haven't
3. Install the require packages: `npm install`
4. Install MongoDB Compass (https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) if you haven't
5. Create a database named "uwc_v2" and add two collections called "staffs" and "tasks"
6. Add some data to each of the collections. The data should have the following formats:
<img src="readme_mongo1.png" width="450"/> <img src="readme_mongo2.png" width="450"/> 

7. Run the application: `node server.js`. The email and password for login is `vovankha2003@gmail.com` and `admin123`

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Search for a task by its ID, status, date; or by collector's name.
- 🔔 Send task notification to employee.
- ✅ Confirm done tasks
- 🌈 CRUD Operations on tasks.
- 🕓 View optimize route of a collector's task

## ⚠️ Limitations
1. Route, MCP and Vehicle Management not yet implemented
2. Each route can go through at most 3 MCPs
3. The system does not have statistical information on vehicle, MCPs and staffs
4. User profile and message not yet implemented

## Deployment
Deploy at https://busy-red-pike-cuff.cyclic.app (but it was so bad 'cause this was the first time I have worked with NodeJS) with account used for accessing: vovankha2003@gmail.com and password : `admin123`
